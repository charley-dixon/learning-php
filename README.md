# LEARNING PHP

## Introduction

A long time ago I decided that I wanted to build a Wordpress-based portfolio so that I could have a CMS for creating blog content to develop my online voice. I purchased the domain, set up hosting, installed Wordpress, and began to customize different themes - but it was never quite enough control for my liking. I decided that I needed to learn how to develop Wordpress themes from scratch, which is when I came across [this course](https://youtu.be/-h7gOJbIpmo). Quickly I realized that I had insufficient knowledge of the prerequisite information to complete the course, and it was finally time to learn PHP (something I had been pushing off for awhile).

This repository is built with resources created during [this PHP from scratch tutorial](https://youtu.be/OK_JCtrrv-c).

In order to view the files, you must have PHP installed on your computer and opened up on a local server. Follow these steps once PHP is installed (should be installed by default for Mac users):

1. Open CLI
2. Navigate to desired root directory
3. Type `php -S localhost:4000` to open root directory on port 4000
4. In the URL bar, add `/path/file-name.php` to the file pathway to open the desired file name.
